/**
 * @dev Contract that manages deployment and upgrades of delegatecall proxies.
 *
 * An implementation identifier can be created on the proxy manager which is
 * used to specify the logic address for a particular contract type, and to
 * upgrade the implementation as needed.
 *
 * ====== Proxy Types ======
 * A one-to-one proxy is a single proxy contract with an upgradeable implementation
 * address.
 *
 * A many-to-one proxy is a single upgradeable implementation address that may be
 * used by many proxy contracts.
 *
 * ====== Access Control ======
 * The proxy manager has a single address as its owner.
 *
 * The owner is the sole account with the following permissions:
 * - Create new many-to-one implementations
 * - Create new one-to-one proxies
 * - Modify the implementation address of existing proxies
 * - Lock proxies
 * - Designate approved deployers
 * - Remove approved deployers
 * - Modify the owner address
 *
 * Approved deployers may only deploy many-to-one proxies.
 *
 * ====== Upgrades ======
 * Proxies can be upgraded by the owner if they are not locked.
 *
 * Many-to-one proxy implementations are upgraded by calling the holder contract
 * for the implementation ID being upgraded.
 * One-to-one proxies are upgraded by calling the proxy contract directly.
 *
 * The owner can lock a one-to-one proxy or many-to-one implementation ID so that
 * it becomes impossible to upgrade.
