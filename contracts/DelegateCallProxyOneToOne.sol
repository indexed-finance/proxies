 * If any other account calls the proxy, it will delegatecall the implementation address with the received
 * calldata and ether. If the call succeeds, it will return with the received returndata.
 * If it reverts, it will revert with the received revert data.

 * This slot must not be used by the implementation contract.
 *
 * Note: This contract does not verify that the implementation address is a valid delegation target.
